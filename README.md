This project will help to check if spelling of word input by user is correct and to suggest correct spellings in case the input word is incorrect. This would be carried out using Tries data structure. We will also be displaying the time it takes to search for a particular word using tries and by Brute force method to show how fast it is to search for a word using tries.
 
A Trie is a special data structure used to store strings that can be visualized like a graph. It consists of nodes and edges like a tree. Each node consists of at max 26 children and edges connect each parent node to its children. These 26 pointers are nothing but pointers for each of the 26 alphabets in English language.
 
Tries are very useful as we can search a word in O(n) time where n is the length of a string/word we need to find.
 
Our code has been written in C++. The GUI has been created using Qt.
